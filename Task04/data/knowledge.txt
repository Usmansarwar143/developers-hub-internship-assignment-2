## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a dynamic subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human intervention. Rather than following explicitly programmed instructions, ML systems evolve by analyzing examples and adapting their behavior accordingly.

There are several types of Machine Learning:

1. **Supervised Learning** – The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input comes with the correct output. This is commonly used in classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices).
2. **Unsupervised Learning** – The algorithm explores the structure of unlabeled data to identify patterns, clusters, or relationships. Common applications include customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
3. **Semi-supervised Learning** – Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.
4. **Reinforcement Learning** – An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This approach is used in robotics, gaming (e.g., AlphaGo), and autonomous vehicles.

Key components of ML include:
- **Datasets**: The foundation of ML — curated examples for the model to learn from.
- **Models**: Mathematical representations that map inputs to outputs.
- **Features**: Attributes extracted from raw data to feed the model.
- **Training & Testing**: The learning process involves training the model on known data and validating it on unseen data.

ML is transforming industries such as:
- **Healthcare**: Predicting disease outcomes, personalizing treatments.
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, stock prediction, credit scoring.
- **Retail**: Recommendation systems, inventory forecasting.
- **Transportation**: Route optimization, autonomous driving.

Modern ML frameworks include **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Keras** — empowering developers to design, train, and deploy powerful models with minimal effort.

As data becomes more abundant and computing more efficient, ML continues to redefine what machines can achieve — making it one of the most critical and exciting technologies of our time.
